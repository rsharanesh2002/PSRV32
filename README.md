# PSRV32
A CPU Core built upon RISC-V Archiecture         
### Design and Implementation of 5-Stage Pipeline Architecture using Verilog
* 5-stage Pipelining consists of the following stages:
  - Instruction Fetch (IF)
  - Instruction Decode (ID)
  - Execute (EX)
  - Memory Access (MEM)
  - Writeback (WB)           

- [ ] The Verilog code for each of the stages and their internal sub-modules shall included as .v files.       
- [ ] Inorder to overcome the dependencies resulting into hazards, we have to include a Hazard Detection Unit (To stall) and a Data Forwarding Unit (To forward) the data.
